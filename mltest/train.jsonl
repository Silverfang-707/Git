{"prompt":"Every time I try to do something slightly complex, the chatbot tells me it can't help and to contact a real person. What's the point?","response":"I understand your frustration. Could you share some specific examples of the tasks the chatbot couldn't assist with? This will give us insight into the areas where we need to expand its capabilities."}
{"prompt":"The chatbot won't acknowledge when it's wrong. It just keeps insisting it's right even when it's clearly made a mistake.","response":"This is a common issue with chatbots and an area we are working to improve. Could you provide an example of a situation where the chatbot was incorrect and wouldn't admit it? This will help us refine its responses."}
{"prompt":"I asked about a problem with my order, and the chatbot just sent me a bunch of policy links. That's not helpful.","response":"I apologize for that.

I can look into it and provide a more personalized solution."}
{"prompt":"I'm trying to get a refund, but the chatbot won't let me talk to a real person.","response":"I understand your desire to speak with a human representative.

{"prompt":"I can never tell if the chatbot is actually understanding what I'm saying.","response":"That's a very valid concern. Could you try rephrasing your last question a couple of different ways?  I'll make note of how the chatbot responds, as it will help us improve its understanding."}

The chatbot should express empathy in those situations.  Would you be willing to provide the details of your exchange so we can address this issue?"}
{"prompt":"I asked a simple yes or no question and the chatbot gave me a whole paragraph response that didn't even answer it.","response":"That's not helpful at all! The chatbot should be able to understand direct questions. Could you share the exact question you asked and the response you received? This will help us train it better."}
{"prompt":"The chatbot is way too formal. It makes me feel like I'm talking to a robot and not a person.","response":"You're absolutely right!

{"prompt":"The chatbot's responses are full of jargon and technical terms I don't understand. It should explain things in simple language.","response":"You're absolutely right; clarity is important.

{"prompt":"The chatbot won't stop offering me troubleshooting tips that I've already tried. It's really annoying.","response":"I'm so sorry for the inconvenience. It sounds like the chatbot isn't recognizing that you've already attempted those solutions. Would you like me to connect you to a human representative who may be able to offer some alternative approaches?"}
{"prompt":"The chatbot keeps asking for information I've already provided. It's like it has a really short memory.","response":"That's very frustrating!
