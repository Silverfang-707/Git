{"prompt":"Half the time, the chatbot's responses don't even make sense in the context of what I asked.","response":"I apologize for the confusion. Could you provide an example of a response that didn't make sense?  This feedback is incredibly valuable to help us identify areas where the chatbot needs improvement."}
{"prompt":"Why does the chatbot keep apologizing without actually offering any solutions? It's not very helpful.","response":"You're right; apologies alone don't solve problems. Let me try a different approach. Could you please restate your main issue, and  I'll see if I can provide a direct solution or connect you with someone who can."}
